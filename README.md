### Course objectives ###
This course aims to equip beginner-level Computer Science students with fundamentals of mathematics essential for their major studies. This course is to articulate students in how to read and write technical descriptions in Computer Science effectively, in how to count or enumerate things, and in how to reason scientific facts with discrete structures such as sets, relations, permutations, graphs, and trees. Students are expected to understand how the fundamental concepts are applied to solve computing problems of real world.
